# Flight Reservation System âœˆðŸ–¥
Create a program that makes reservations for airline tickets. The program should read
information about flights (number, origin and destination) and the number of seats available for twelve
planes (one vector for each of these data). 

After reading, the program should present a menu with the following options:
     
     â– â–  consult;
     â– â–  make a reservation; It is
     â– â–  leave.
     
 When the option chosen is Consult, another menu should be available with the following
 options:
 
    â– â–  by flight number;
    â– â–  by origin; It is
    â– â–  by destination.

    
 When the option chosen is Make reservation, the person must be asked for the flight number on which they wish to travel. The program should give the following 
answers:

    â– â–  confirmed reservation â€” if the flight and seat are available, canceling available seats;
    â– â–  fully booked flight â€” if there is no seat available on that flight;
    â– â–  non-existent flight â€” if the flight code does not exist.

The Exit option is the only one that allows you to end the program execution. Therefore, after each operation
consultation or reservation, the program returns to the main menu.
